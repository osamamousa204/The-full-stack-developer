                <h3>What Exactly Is A Full-Stack Web Developer?!</h3>
                <p>Full-stack developers are experts in both the front-end and back-end;
                    so, the full stack of technology that makes up a website. They are
                    proficient in both front-end and back-end languages and frameworks, as well as
                    in server, network and hosting environments. To get to this breadth and depth 
                    of knowledge, most full-stack developers will have spent many years working in 
                    a variety of different roles. They also tend to be well-versed in both business 
                    logic and user experience, meaning they are not only well-equipped to get
                     hands on, but can also guide and consult on strategy too.

                        <p>
                            This skillset involves the actual presentation of your 
                            websiteâ€”how the information in your website is laid out
                             in browsers and on mobile devices as well. A dedicated 
                             front-end developer will be very experienced working with 
                             HTML and CSS as well as the scripting language, JavaScript.
                              With these languages, the developer can very efficiently manipulate
                             the information on a website to make it appealing and effective.

                            Creation, edit/update and recollection of data are some of the processes that are most 
                            often associated with back-end development. Some examples of common scripting languages 
                            used are PHP, Ruby, and Python. With these languages, a back-end developer can create
                             algorithms and business logic to manipulate the data that was received in front-end 
                             development.
